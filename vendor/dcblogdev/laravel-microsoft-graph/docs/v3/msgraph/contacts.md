title: Contacts
---

MsGraph provides a clean way of working with a user's contacts.

To work with contacts first call **->contacts()** followed by a method.

```php
MsGraph::contacts()
```

## Listing Contacts

Return a list of all contacts

```php
MsGraph::contacts()->get()
```

By default, only 10 contacts are returned this can be changed by either using GET requests or pass an array of option to get()

Option 1: GET Request

Adding **top=50** to the URL will return 50 contacts, to skip the starting point use **skip=2** to start from the 2nd set. These can be used together:

```php
?top=50&skip=2
```

Option 2: Array

The default array that is used internally is below, you can override these options by passing an array to the **->get()** method.

```php
[
    "\$orderby" => "displayName",
    "\$top" => $top,
    "\$skip" => $skip,
    "\$count" => "true",
]
```

This would look like this:

```php
MsGraph::contacts()->get([
    "\$orderby" => "displayName",
    "\$top" => 100,
    "\$skip" => 0,
    "\$count" => "true",
]);
```

The response returned is an array in this format:

```php
array:4 [
  "contacts" => array:4 [
    "@odata.context" => "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users('5b7f8791-03a1-4b68-9ff2-5bdca45563')/contacts"
    "@odata.count" => 1112
    "@odata.nextLink" => "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/5b7f8791-03a1-4b68-9ff2-5bdca45563/contacts?$orderby=displayName&$top=50&$skip=52&$count=true"
    "value" => array:50 [

                "address" => "j.smith@domain.co.uk"
              ]
            ]

        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  "total" => 1112
  "top" => "50"
  "skip" => "52"
]
```

The **@odata.nextLink** is the link for the next set of data that can be used directly or make use of the top and skip that are returned.

];

MsGraph::contacts()->store($data);

    ]
];

MsGraph::contacts()->update($id, $data);
